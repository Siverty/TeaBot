# TeaBot
An open source discord bot.

TeaBot is actively being developed to give people with an interest in coding a discord bot insight how to make one.
This bot will be filled with usefull features like a music bot, reactionroles, clear command, role restrictions on commands and many more!

The bot will never be "finished" because discord an NODE.JS will always add new features to expand upon.


Feel free to contact the devs to help with this project as any help is welcome!

Also feel free to use segments of our code and don't be shy to let us know, any feedback will be looked at and is more than welcome!

(some childish jokes remain in the bot code, ignore this because this was purely used for test purpouses)
